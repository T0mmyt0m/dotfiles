# Bash Setup Script Documentation

## Overview
This script automates the setup of a user's Bash environment by:
- Checking for required packages (`git`, `curl`, and `wget`) and notifying the user if any are missing.
- Creating a symbolic link (or copying) the `.bash_aliases` file from the `~/dotfiles` repository to the user's home directory.
- Reminding the user to reload their Bash environment (`source ~/.bashrc`) or log out and back in for the changes to take effect.

## Files Involved
### `setup_bashrc.sh`
- A Bash script that automates the process of checking dependencies, managing `.bash_aliases`, and notifying the user about environment reloading.
- Ensures `.bash_aliases` is correctly linked to `~/dotfiles/.bash_aliases`, maintaining consistency between the dotfiles repository and the active shell environment.

### `.bash_aliases`
- A file containing user-defined aliases to improve command-line efficiency.
- Typically sourced in `.bashrc` to ensure aliases are available in all new terminal sessions.

## Usage
1. **Make the script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup_bashrc.sh
   ```
2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   ./setup_bashrc.sh
   ```
3. **Reload Bash configuration:**
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```
   Or log out and log back in.
