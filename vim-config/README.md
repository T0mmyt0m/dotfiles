# Vim Configuration

## Required Files

This folder contains the necessary files to customize and configure Vim using Vundle.

### 1. `.vimrc`

- Manually created (not generated by script)
- Located in `vim-config/.vimrc`
- Includes:
  - Vundle setup block
  - At least two plugins:
    - Colorscheme: `jellybeans`
    - Improvement: `indent-guides`, `fugitive`
  - Final line sets the colorscheme:
    ```vim
    colorscheme jellybeans
    ```

### 2. `setup-vim.sh`

A helper script to automate your Vim setup.

#### What it does:

- Copies `.vimrc` from this folder to your home directory (`~/.vimrc`)
- Installs Vundle if not already present in `~/.vim/bundle`
- Installs all plugins listed in `.vimrc` via:
  ```bash
  vim +PluginInstall +qall
ðŸ’¡ This script does not generate the .vimrc â€” you must manually write it.
